# About

Hi, welcome to the about page! I made this website to serve primarily as a place for me to dump some of my [research](/research-current/) and other miscellaneous [projects](/projects/) that may or may not have anything to do with mathematics! I also do some teaching of various mathematical topics, and courses that I have (am) taught (teaching) will be listed on the [teaching](/teaching/) tab. If you are interested, you can find my [CV](/docs/CV.pdf), where I have listed more explicit details of my academic life. Thanks for visiting!
