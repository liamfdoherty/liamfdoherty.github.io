# Welcome!

Hi! I'm Liam Doherty, an Applied Mathematics PhD student at Drexel University. I am interested in the intersection of numerical analysis, machine learning, and high-performance computing! If you'd like to know more, check out my [about page](/about/). I also have information about my [teaching](/teaching/), my current and past [research](/research-current/), and some of the other [projects](/projects/) that I work on. Enjoy!
