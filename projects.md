[//]: # (**Just How Valid _is_ the Small Angle Approximation? An Uncertainty Quantification Approach** Jokes around the internet exist about the so-called "small angle approximation" in physics, referring to a simplifying assumption in the equation of motion for a pendulum to make it analytically solvable. However, this approximation is only valid when the initial angle of displacement is small. But just how small _is_ small, and can we quantify it when we have uncertainty in the initial condition? We apply an uncertainty quantification (UQ) framework to address this. [Read More](/projects/small-angle-validity/))
